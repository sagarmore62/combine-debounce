# Combine Framework - Debounce Demo
App demostrates, how to optimise Search through Debounce feature in Combine framework

## Debounce :
The debounce that allows us to throttle changes we receive when typing into a search field.
Publishes elements only after a specified time interval elapses between events.
With this property, we can optimise the search operation in app by throttling the search api call after fixed time interval.
Results in optimisation of device battery and data cost.
